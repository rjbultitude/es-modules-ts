# Native ES Modules Demo

This small app demonstrates the following characteristics of native ESM (JavaScript Modules)
 * Configuration of module type at root
 * Import of local first-party dependencies
 * Import of 3rd party dependencies (lodash - times)
 * Dynamic import of first-party dependencies
 * One to one mapping of local files and runtime ones

## Setup
Install the dependancies `npm install`
The run `npm run build` - this will transpile TS to JS
Then run `npm run start`
